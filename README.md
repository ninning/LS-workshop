# Light Seq workshop

The following is a series of jupyter notebooks we used as a workshop and walkthrough of the analysis code used in our Light-Seq paper.

There is also a seperate walkthrough for setting up the environment on Harvards o2 compute cluster for Harvard users.

The example dataset used in this demo reproduces some of the retina amacrine barcoding experiment numbers shown in Figure 5.

The notebooks themselves will only be updated infrequently depending on feedback from people.
